# gradeCalculatorUI
A grade calculator made with a gui using tkinter

This is a simple UI made using TKinter. You need both files to run the program and the main file that is needed to run is the UI file. It is not necessarily the most optimal grade calculator however I made it because in my mind canvas does not always give the most accurate grades. I kinda found out through this project that UI design is not necessarily for me.
